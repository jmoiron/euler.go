I started doing project euler in go to learn go.  I've since [written](http://github.com/jmoiron/monet) [some decently complex](http://github.com/jmoiron/mandira) projects in go, but continue to do Euler in go because I find it's got a good blend of higher level functionality and low level speed.

I approached the problems more or less in order, though there is a large gap between some.  The level of idiomaticity of the code in these files varies quite greatly from extremely naive, ungofmted code, to fairly succinct, efficient code in some later problems.
